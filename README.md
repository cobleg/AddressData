# AddressData

This repository contains the R code required to explore the [Geoscape Geocoded National Address File (GNAF)](https://data.gov.au/data/dataset/geocoded-national-address-file-g-naf). The G-NAF data set is the geocoded address database for Australian businesses and governments. It’s the trusted source of geocoded address data for Australia with over 50 million contributed addresses distilled into 15.4 million G-NAF addresses.

The main data file is augmented with data from the [Australian Population and Housing Census data set](https://www.abs.gov.au/census).
