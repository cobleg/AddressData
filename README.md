# AddressData

This repository contains the R code required to explore the [Geoscape Geocoded National Address data set](https://data.gov.au/data/dataset/geocoded-national-address-file-g-naf). The G-NAF data set is the geocoded address database for Australian businesses and governments. Itâ€™s the trusted source of geocoded address data for Australia with over 50 million contributed addresses distilled into 15.4 million G-NAF addresses.

The main data file is augmented with data from the [Australian Population and Housing Census data set](https://www.abs.gov.au/census).
