## Introduction
This web site contains helpful information about processing the Geoscape G-NAF data set. This is a spatial data set containing 15 million physical addresses. This is an open data set that is used to:
- help emergency services locate building access points
- validate addresses for online forms
- infrastructure and land use planning.

[Click on this link for more information about the data set can be found here.](https://www.industry.gov.au/news/open-address-data-better-services)

Given the complexity of the G-NAF data, it can be tricky figuring out how to manipulate it. So this repository contains some worked examples using open source applications such as R. 

## Key steps
### Step 1 (Import the data)
Download the data set, which is named [Aug 23 - Geoscape G-NAF - GDA2020](https://data.gov.au/data/dataset/19432f89-dc3a-4ef3-b943-5326ef1dbecc/resource/28cf3c40-faa3-4802-9177-3ec9e9aa0a0f/download/g-naf_aug23_allstates_gda2020_psv_1012.zip). Unzip and place in an R project file.

Save in an R project data folder.

Write a script to import the data, for example:
```{r}
# Objective: import GNAF address data
# Author: Grant Coble-Neal
# Dependencies: nil

library(here)

library(tidyverse)

df.0 <- read.table(here("data", "G-NAF", "G-NAF AUGUST 2023", "Standard", "ACT_ADDRESS_ALIAS_psv.psv"), sep = "|", header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
head(df)

```

### Step 2 (Process the data)

### Step 3 (Export data subsets)
